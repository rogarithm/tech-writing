what to reorganize?

answers in feedback is actually, not my work. Store these in the Github is not proper usage. So are the cmp files. Here's my thoughts:

- make private branch or repo for feedback only, and research how to do my jobs done with this setup.

cmp files are inefficient to review my answers. summarizing the sentences that needs to be summarized is better. but there's a case when I need to see the diffs of my answers with feedbacks. Here's my thoughs:

- write a summaries in one big file.

- refine cmp files easy to search specific word

checking article is now on a separate branch. but do i really need another branch? or is there a way to keep it more practical to maintain this branch?
