    <div id="doc"><h1>Ac­cu­ra­cy</h1><p>Inaccurate information make users upset, and make them not to read the document anymore. If a document directs users to do tasks inaccurately, the more the users have done things inaccurately, the more they’ll be upset about the document and the product, because they’ll have to do extra work after they find out they did it wrong.</p><h2>Write in­for­ma­tion only when you un­der­stand, and ver­i­fy af­ter that.</h2><p>Sometimes you can easily understand the subject that you can write it quickly. But there’s times you can’t. Even when technical experts can’t help you, you must do your job. In that case, start with what you do understand to write your first draft. It could be helpful to include questions to the experts so that you can ask them later more clearly with your draft.</p><p>If you get pressured by not understanding a subject well, keep in mind that you don’t need to understand the subject as much as developers. Understanding too well could be a problem, because you might not understand why users have problems with the product. This can make your document hard to read and understand.</p><p>When you write procedures, you need to understand how users are likely to use the procedures to perform relevant tasks. Assume they have to solve problems using your document and there priority is solving the problems, not deeply understaning your document.</p><p>The best way to understand a technical subject that you are writing about is to use the product as a user would.</p><h2>Keep up with tech­ni­cal changes.</h2><p>Technical information should be up-to-date. It could be outdated easily. It’s better not to use terms strongly related to change or release of products, because you’ll need to modify them along the changes. So don’t use the terms as much as you can, but if you have to, careful to modify them up to latest version.</p><p>Because it’s easier to update Web-based document, users expect it to be updated in regular basis. Let users know about specifications of updates: when you’ll update the document, what is changed from last updates, and/or making a way to get feedbacks from users.</p><h2>Main­tain con­sis­ten­cy of all in­for­ma­tion about a sub­ject.</h2><p>When there’s multiple places the information is located, you may need to reuse some part of the information. If the part is short and unlikely to change in the future, just copy and paste would be sufficient. For longer one, and if you don’t want to copy, use single source approach. That is, use the same source for different outputs.</p><p>In this book, reuse is the same as single source approach.</p><p>Parts (that is, <em>topic</em>) of source can be used in multiple documents. When you need an update, editing only source helps to improve consistency and time consuming.</p><h2>Reuse in­for­ma­tion when pos­si­ble</h2><p>usecases. For detail, see p79.</p><h2>Avoid in­tro­duct­ing in­con­sis­ten­cies and elim­i­nate those that you find</h2><p>There’s information that cannot be reused. You must synchronize them. To be effective, minimize the number of repeated information through multiple documents.</p><p>If you use a table in your document and refer to the table somewhere in the document, accurately and consistently write the required content to use. Inaccurately refered content makes users confused.</p><p>Good practices mentioned by the author is well explained. If you need detail, see p82.</p><p>Headings or names of elements should be consistent with their content of the topic. Also, examples should be consistent with the content that related to the examples.</p><h2>Use tools that au­to­mate check­ing for ac­cu­ra­cy.</h2><p>Typographical and grammar errors break users’ trust about the document. You can eaily find and correct these errors by using automated tools. Choose a proper tool and use carefully.</p><h2>Check the ac­cu­ra­cy of ref­er­ences to re­lat­ed in­for­ma­tion.</h2></div>
