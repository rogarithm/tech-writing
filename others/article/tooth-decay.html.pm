◊q provided line graph describes what happens when we consume ◊q sweet foods in the form of ◊q fruit sugar, ◊q honey, and ◊q cane sugar, and how ◊q resulting increased acid levels create ◊q potential for ◊q tooth decay.

As is presented in ◊q graph, ◊q sugar consumption in ◊q various forms leads to ◊q higher acidity, represented by ◊q lower PH levels. ◊q These PH levels are at their lowest at ◊q 5 minutes after eating ◊q sugar, and they gradually increase until they reach 5.5, at which point ◊q tooth decay is no longer likely.

◊q Cane sugar is clearly ◊q most dangerous type of ◊q sugar, among those represented in ◊q graph.

◊q[ooo+]{the} provided line graph describes what happens when we consume ◊q[xox+]{zero} sweet foods in the form of ◊q[xx+]{zero} fruit sugar, ◊q[xx+]{zero} honey, and ◊q[xx+]{zero} cane sugar, and how ◊q[xox+]{zero} resulting increased acid levels create ◊q[xx+]{zero} potential for ◊q[xx+]{zero} tooth decay.

◊#{
	1. the graphs is presented with this text.
	2. Thought that food is general so it should be uncountable, but the text use plural. Is this a signal that this "food" is more specifc that enables it to be countable?
	3-5. general concept
	6. verb is "create". The "acid levels" is not specific.
	7. "tooth decay" narrows the scope of "potential", but it's not complete.
	8. general concept

As is presented in ◊q[ooo+]{the} graph, ◊q[ox+]{the} sugar consumption in ◊q[oox+]{the} various forms leads to ◊q[ox+]{the} higher acidity, represented by ◊q[xox+]{zero} lower PH levels. ◊q[oox+]{the->zero} These PH levels are at their lowest at ◊q[oox+]{zero} 5 minutes after eating ◊q[xx+]{zero} sugar, and they gradually increase until they reach 5.5, at which point ◊q[xx+]{zero} tooth decay is no longer likely.

◊#{
	1. stated in the first paragraph.
	2. In the first paragraph, the author says about it: "consume sweet foods in the form of fruit sugar, ..."
	3. Same as right before: "form of ..."
	4. "resulting increased acid levels" in the first paragraph. General concept->uncountable.
	5. There's no description of "PH levels."
	6. from the use of "these." Definitive judging from the "PH levels" right before.
	7. exception?
	8. Although there's texts of "sugar", since they're generic, we cannot be sure about its speicificity.
	9. Same as the explanation of ◊q right before.

◊q[xx+]{zero} Cane sugar is clearly ◊q[ooo+]{the} most dangerous type of ◊q[xx+]{zero} sugar, among those represented in ◊q[ooo+]{the} graph.

◊#{
	1. Same as the explanation of ◊q right before
	2. seems it should be "the", but is this specific?
	3. As before, generic.
	4. we're saying about the graph this text gives us
