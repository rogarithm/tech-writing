◊q Culture is ◊q shared system of ◊q values, ◊q beliefs, and ◊q attitudes that shapes ◊q individual's ◊q perception and ◊q behavior.

Simplistically, ◊q individuals can be considered to be ◊q products of ◊q one culture, and it is assumed that ◊q individual's ◊q culture is ◊q same as ◊q his or her racial or ethnic identity.

However, in ◊q United States, ◊q individuals are often ◊q products of ◊q multiple cultures.

When ◊q culture was first studied in ◊q anthropology, it was assumed that ◊q individual could ultimately only have ◊q aspects of ◊q one culture.

In ◊q other words, ◊q person exposed to more than ◊q one culture would eventually assimilate into one of tehm, presumably ◊q majority culture.

◊#{"an individual" and "individual". It seems to mean more than general, so I used an.}

Simplistically, ◊q[xox]{zero} individuals can be considered to be ◊q[xox]{zero} products of ◊q[xoo+]{a->zero} one culture, and it is assumed that ◊q[xoo]{an} individual's ◊q[xx]{zero} culture is ◊q[ox+]{the} same as ◊q[xx]{zero} his or her racial or ethnic identity.

◊#{
	1. "a culture", but using "one" removes "a".
  2. can "same" be thought of (un)countable?

◊#{
	1. From "States," should it be plural? Or singular as it's a name of one nation?
	2. I think "individuals in the United States" specifies "individual", so used "the".

◊#{
	1. "anthropology" is a study subject that exists only one, so it should be definitive.
	2. "individual" in the context seems to represent a concept of individual, not each of a separated person.
	3. "a culture", but using "one" removes "a".

In ◊q[xox]{zero} other words, ◊q[xoo]{a} person exposed to more than ◊q[xoo]{a->zero} one culture would eventually assimilate into one of them, presumably ◊q[xx+]{zero} majority culture.

◊#{
	1. "culture" is used as either countable or uncountable. What's the standard of decision?
